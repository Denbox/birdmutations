# birdmutations
convert strings to bird codes for trivia questions

This is a quick script for a friend who wanted to permute names to a bunch of bird codes.
It's somewhat slow, but was fun to make and is hopefully commented for more novice programmers! ...even though I used generators which took me forever to understand at first. Oh well! Go make some bird puzzles.
